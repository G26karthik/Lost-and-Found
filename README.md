#  College Lost & Found â€” A Full-Stack MERN Experience

Welcome to the College Lost & Found platform! This is a modern web app built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that helps students and staff report, search, and recover lost or found items on campus. The project is designed for real-world use, with a focus on clean code, robust authentication, and a smooth user experience.

## What Does This Project Do?

Imagine youâ€™ve lost your headphones on campus, or youâ€™ve found someoneâ€™s ID card. Instead of posting on random WhatsApp groups, you can use this app to report lost or found items, browse all reports, and connect with the rightful owner or finder. The platform handles user registration, secure login, item reporting (with images!), and lets users mark items as returned. Itâ€™s mobile-friendly, easy to use, and built for real deployment.

## How the System Works

At its core, this is a classic full-stack app:

- **Frontend:** React (with Tailwind CSS for styling) provides a responsive, single-page experience. Users interact with forms, lists, and dashboards.
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express exposes a REST API, handles authentication (JWT), file uploads (Multer), and talks to MongoDB Atlas for data storage.
- **Database:** MongoDB stores users and item reports, with all the details youâ€™d expect (who reported, what, when, status, etc).
- **Integration:** The React frontend talks to the backend via API calls. In production, the backend serves the React build, so everything is on one domain.

---

## Backend Walkthrough: API Design & Endpoints

The backend is organized with clarity in mind:

- **Entry Point:** `server/server.js` sets up Express, connects to MongoDB, configures CORS, and serves static files in production.
- **Routes:** All API endpoints are under `/api/users` (for authentication) and `/api/items` (for item management).
- **Controllers:** Logic is separated into controller files (`controllers/userController.js`, `controllers/itemController.js`), keeping routes clean.
- **Models:** Mongoose models (`models/userModel.js`, `models/itemModel.js`) define the schema for users and items.

### Major Endpoints

- `POST /api/users/register` â€” Register with your roll number (password is your roll number in uppercase).
- `POST /api/users/login` â€” Log in and receive a JWT token.
- `POST /api/items` â€” Report a new lost/found item (with image upload).
- `GET /api/items` â€” List all items, with filtering and sorting via query params.
- `GET /api/items/:id` â€” Get details for a specific item.
- `PUT /api/items/:id/status` â€” Mark an item as returned.

**Request Handling:**  
Each route uses middleware for authentication (`authMiddleware.js`), validation (`express-validator`), and file uploads (`multer`). Errors are handled gracefully, with clear messages sent to the frontend.

## Frontend Walkthrough: React Structure & Logic

The React app lives in `client/src/` and is organized for clarity and reusability:

- **Pages & Components:**  
  - `Login.js`, `Register.js` â€” Auth forms.
  - `Dashboard.js` â€” Main user dashboard.
  - `ReportForm.js` â€” Form to report a lost/found item (handles image upload).
  - `ItemsList.js` â€” Shows all reported items, with filters and sorting.
  - `ItemDetail.js` â€” Detailed view for a single item, including contact info and status updates.
  - `HelpedStats.js` â€” (Optional) Stats on how many items have been returned.

- **Routing:**  
  Uses `react-router-dom` for navigation. Auth state is managed in `App.js` and passed down as needed.

- **Styling:**  
  Tailwind CSS is used throughout for a modern, responsive look.

- **API Calls:**  
  All API requests use Axios, and the base URL is set via the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable for easy deployment.

## User Experience Flow

1. **Registration & Login:**  
   Users register with their roll number; the default password is their roll number in uppercase. On login, a JWT token is stored in localStorage.

2. **Reporting an Item:**  
   After logging in, users can report a lost or found item. The form collects details and an image, which is uploaded to the server.

3. **Browsing & Searching:**  
   Users can browse all items, filter by category (lost/found), status (open/returned), and sort by date.

4. **Item Details & Recovery:**  
   Clicking an item shows full details. If youâ€™re the reporter, you can mark it as returned. If youâ€™re a finder, you can contact the owner (if they allowed it).

5. **Status Updates:**  
   When an item is marked as returned, itâ€™s updated in the database and reflected in the UI.

## Data Flow: Frontend â†” Backend

- **Authentication:**  
  On login/register, the backend returns a JWT token. The frontend stores this and sends it in the `Authorization` header for all protected API calls.

- **Item Reporting:**  
  The frontend sends a `multipart/form-data` POST request (with image) to the backend. The backend saves the image and item details, then returns the new item.

- **Fetching Items:**  
  The frontend fetches items with filters/sorting as query params. The backend returns a filtered, sorted list.

- **Status Updates:**  
  PUT requests update item status; the backend checks permissions and updates the DB.

---

## Smart Features & Logic

- **Validation:**  
  Both backend (with `express-validator`) and frontend validate user input, ensuring roll numbers are alphanumeric and of correct length.

- **Search & Filtering:**  
  The backend supports filtering by category/status and sorting by date, all via query params.

- **Image Uploads:**  
  Multer handles file uploads, storing images in a dedicated folder and serving them statically.

- **Authentication:**  
  JWT-based, with middleware to protect all sensitive routes.

- **Reusable Components:**  
  Forms, error messages, and item cards are built as reusable React components.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Consistent error messages are sent from backend to frontend, and displayed clearly to users.

---

## Code Patterns & Design Decisions

- **Controller-Service Pattern:**  
  All business logic is in controllers, keeping routes clean and maintainable.

- **React Hooks:**  
  `useEffect` is used for data fetching, `useState` for local state, and all API calls are wrapped in async functions with error handling.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  API URLs and secrets are never hardcoded; everything is managed via `.env` files for security and flexibility.

- **Production-Ready:**  
  The backend serves the React build in production, so deployment is simple (one service on Render.com).

- **Thoughtful UX:**  
  The app gives clear feedback for loading, errors, and success states. All actions are protected and validated.

---

## Challenges & Design Choices

- **Seamless Deployment:**  
  One of the trickiest parts was ensuring the frontend and backend work together in both local and production environments. Using environment variables and serving the React build from Express solved this.

- **Image Handling:**  
  Supporting image uploads required careful setup of Multer and static file serving, especially for cloud deployment.

- **Authentication Flow:**  
  Keeping the JWT logic simple but secure, and making sure the frontend always sends the right token, was key for a smooth user experience.

## Lessons Learned

Building this project was a great exercise in full-stack development. It reinforced the importance of:

- Keeping code modular and organized (controllers, models, components).
- Handling errors gracefully, both for users and developers.
- Thinking about deployment from the start â€” not just local dev.
- Using environment variables for all secrets and URLs.
- Writing code thatâ€™s easy for others (and your future self) to understand and extend.
